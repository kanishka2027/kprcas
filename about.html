<p>.ice. I know that (and sort of agree) that Beyonce Knowles-Carter as Nala looks and sounds good on paper but I kinda feel she was miscast in this...again maybe I'm just too used to the original. The voice actor and actress for young Simba and Nala were really good, and Rogen and Eichtner were fun at times. The soundtrack is definitely a step down...there's really only one song that I think that even comes close to being on the same line as the original </p>
<p>"Flight" only gets made with someone like Robert Zemeckis given it the go ahead. Which is its own kind of irony, since Zemeckis has never made a film like this before.

In fact, its one of the only R-Rated movies to come from Zemeckis. And it's the only one to deal with thematic material we are more accustomed seeing in a PT Anderson film over a Zemeckis one. But here we are, and the best decision Zemeckis makes is in the casting of his leading man: The one and only Denzel Washington.</p>
<p>The Good Dinosaur (2015): Dir: Peter Sohn / Voices: Raymond Ochoa, Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand, Anna Paquin, Sam Elliott: Easily outdoes Brave in being the worst Pixar film. This utter juvenile bore is about facing one's fears, which bypasses the title, which makes it sound like this young dinosaur is some sort of do-gooder. It opens with long-neck dinosaurs plowing fields and planting corn. </p>
